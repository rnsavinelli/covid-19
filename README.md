# Understanding the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
Stay informed, make your own conclusions.

covid-tool is a multi-language Linux program prepared to provide you with the latest information on [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) cases and deaths.
Using the [World Health Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization) Database for Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19), covid-tool allows the user to rank countries by cases or deaths, and to retrieve and graph data by country.

The goal of this project is to build an understanding of the virus behaviour and evolution by graphing data.

## About the scripts

[`graph.sh`](graph.sh) and [`updatedatabase.sh`](updatedatabase.sh) are invoked within covid-tool, but were created such that the user can run them as separate tools.

[`graph.R`](graph.R) is wrapped and executed by [`graph.sh`](graph.sh). **Running [`graph.R`](graph.R) on its own is discouraged unless you read its source code**.

## About the database
DISCLAIMER: The consulted database is not of my authorship.

[WHODatabase](https://covid19.who.int/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv) is the WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) database, a collection of all publicly available data about new/cumulative cases and new/cumulative deaths reported to WHO. 
The information available in the database is downloaded by [`updatedatabase.sh`](updatedatabase.sh) using the URL provided the [`DATABASE_URL`](DATABASE_URL) file.

## About the repository
- [`dashboards`](dashboards) containts all the information and graphs of the countries whose data has been generated by covid-tool. It also conatains [`COVID-19-global-cases.csv`](dashboards/COVID-19-global-cases.csv) and [`COVID-19-global-deaths.csv`](dashboards/COVID-19-global-deaths.csv) generated CSV files. These files contain a ranking of all countries by cumulative cases and cumulative deaths respectively, whose data has been reported to WHO.
- [`database`](database) houses all downloaded databases.
- [`src`](src) houses the source files for covid-tool.
